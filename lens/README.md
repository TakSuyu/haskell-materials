# Learning Lens

I tend to focus on core concepts quite a bit more than actual examples, so that
the fundamental understanding of what the examples are trying to teach me is
building on skills I already have just haven't figured out how to use yet.

tl;dr Your mileage may vary. I learn kind of counterintuitively for others.
