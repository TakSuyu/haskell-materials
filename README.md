# Haskell materials

This repository is for content about Haskell. Specific topics may be found in
one of the folders of the repository.

## Learning Haskell

If you are unfamiliar with Haskell and are interested in learning it, I
recommend that you take a look at bitemyapp's guide to do just that.

## Don't see a topic yet?

Feel free to open an issue and request it.

## Want to help?

Submit a pull request or an issue for content to be revised.

## Other thoughts

Hopefully this helps others, as I myself have had mixed success finding good
articles and examples for Haskell compared to other languages. So I wish to
create something that helps others get pushed into the right direction.
