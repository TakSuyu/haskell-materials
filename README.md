# Haskell materials

This repository is for content about Haskell. Specific topics may be found in
one of the folders of the repository.

## Learning Haskell

If you are unfamiliar with Haskell and are interested in learning it, I
recommend that you take a look at [bitemyapp's guide]
(https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) to do just that.

### Places for getting help

If you are familiar with IRC then you can head to `#haskell-beginners` on
Freenode.

If you need help setting up an IRC client, I have provided some screenshots of
how to connect with [KiwiIRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client) which is a web browser
based client.

![Click on Freenode on the right]

![Type in the channel you want to visit]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TakSuyu/haskell-materials/master/assets/kiwi_haskell_beginners_channel.png)

Then you are good to go!

I'll attempt to include other channels for getting specific topic help, but this
is one I'm frequently present in and has a good community that'll help you if
you trying to figure out something.

## Don't see a topic yet?

Feel free to open an issue and request it.

## Want to help?

Submit a pull request or an issue for content to be revised.

## Other thoughts

Hopefully this helps others, as I myself have had mixed success finding good
articles and examples for Haskell compared to other languages. So I wish to
create something that helps others get pushed into the right direction.
